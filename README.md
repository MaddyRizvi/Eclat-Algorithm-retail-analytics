# 🛒 ECLAT Algorithm for Market Basket Optimization

## 📌 Summary

This project applies the **ECLAT (Equivalence Class Clustering and bottom-up Lattice Traversal)** algorithm to identify frequently co-purchased item pairs from a retail dataset. The dataset contains transaction records from a supermarket, where each row represents a customer’s basket of purchased items.

The objective is to uncover strong product associations that can support decision-making in areas such as cross-selling, layout optimization, and product bundling.
